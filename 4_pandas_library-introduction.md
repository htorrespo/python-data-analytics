# The pandas Library—An Introduction

This chapter gets into the heart of this book: the pandas library. This fantastic Python library is a perfect tool for anyone who wants to perform data analysis using Python as a programming language.

First you will learn about the fundamental aspects of this library and how to install it on your system, and then you will become familiar with the two data structures called series and dataframes. During the course of the chapter, you will work with a basic set of functions provided by the pandas library, in order to perform the most common data processing tasks. Getting familiar with these operations is a key goal of the rest of the book. This is why it is very important to repeat this chapter until you feel comfortable with its content.

Furthermore, with a series of examples you will learn some particularly new concepts introduced in the pandas library: indexing data structures. You will learn how to get the most of this feature for data manipulation in this chapter and in the next chapters.

Finally, you will see how to extend the concept of indexing to multiple levels at the same time, through the process called hierarchical indexing.

## Pandas: The Python Data Analysis Library

pandas is an open source Python library for highly specialized data analysis. It is currently the reference point that all professionals using the Python language need to study for the statistical purposes of analysis and decision making.

This library was designed and developed primarily by Wes McKinney starting in 2008. In 2012, Sien Chang, one of his colleagues, was added to the development. Together they set up one of the most used libraries in the Python community.

pandas arises from the need to have a specific library to analyze data that provides, in the simplest possible way, all the instruments for data processing, data extraction, and data manipulation.

This Python package is designed on the basis of the NumPy library. This choice, we can say, was critical to the success and the rapid spread of pandas. In fact, this choice not only makes this library compatible with most other modules, but also takes advantage of the high quality of the NumPy module.

Another fundamental choice was to design ad hoc data structures for data analysis. In fact, instead of using existing data structures built into Python or provided by other libraries, two new data structures were developed.

These data structures are designed to work with relational data or labeled data, thus allowing you to manage data with features similar to those designed for SQL relational databases and Excel spreadsheets.

Throughout the book in fact, you will see a series of basic operations for data analysis, which are normally used on database tables and spreadsheets. pandas in fact provides an extended set of functions and methods that allow you to perform these operations efficiently.

So pandas’ main purpose is to provide all the building blocks for anyone approaching the data analysis world.
