# An Example—Meteorological Data

One type of data easier to find on the net is meteorological data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters such as pressure, temperature, humidity, rain, etc. You only need to specify the location and the date to get a file with data sets of measurements collected by weather stations. These data are a source of wide range of information and as you read in the first chapter of this book, the purpose of data analysis is to transform the raw data into information and then convert it into knowledge.

In this chapter you will see a simple example of how to use meteorological data. This example will be useful to get a general idea of how to apply many of the things seen in the previous chapters.

## A Hypothesis to Be Tested: The Influence of the Proximity of the Sea

At the time of writing of this chapter, I find myself at the beginning of summer and high temperatures begin to be felt, especially for all those live in large cities. On the weekend, many people travel mountain villages or cities close to the sea, to enjoy a little refreshment and get away from the sultry weather of cities inland. This always made me ask, what effect does the proximity of the sea have on the climate?

This simple question can be a good starting point for the data analysis. I don’t want to pass this chapter off as something scientific, just a way for someone passionate about data analysis to put his knowledge into practice in order to answer this question: what influence might the presence of the sea have on the climate of a locality?

### The System in the Study: The Adriatic Sea and the Po Valley

Now that the problem has been defined, it is necessary to look for a system that is well suited to the study of the data and to provide a setting suitable to answer this question.

First you need a sea. Well, I’m in Italy and I have many seas to choose from, since Italy is a peninsula surrounded by seas. Why limit myself to Italy? Well, the problem involves a behavior typical of the Italians, that is, to take refuge in places close to the sea during the summer to avoid the heat of the hinterland. Not knowing if this behavior is the same for the people of other nations, I will only consider Italy as a system of study.

But what areas of Italy might you consider? Well, I said that Italy is a peninsula and that as far as the finding of a sea there is no problem, but what about the assessment of the effects of the sea at various distances? This creates a lot of problems. In fact, Italy is also rich in mountainous areas and also doesn’t have very much territory uniformly extended for many kilometers inland. So, for the assessment of the effects of the sea I want to exclude the mountains, as they may introduce very many other factors, such as altitude for example.
A part of Italy that is well suited to this assessment is the Po Valley. This plain starts from the Adriatic Sea and spreads inland for hundreds of kilometers (see Figure 9-1). It is surrounded by mountains but its great width prevents their effects. It is also rich in towns and so it will be easy to choose a set of cities increasingly distant from the sea, to cover a distance of almost 400 km in this evaluation.
