Data Analysis and Science Using Pandas, matplotlib, and the Python Programming Language


Python Data Analytics will help you tackle the world of data acquisition and analysis using the power of the Python language. At the heart of this book lies the coverage of pandas, an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

Author Fabio Nelli expertly shows the strength of the Python programming language when applied to processing, managing and retrieving information. Inside, you will see how intuitive and flexible it is to discover and communicate meaningful patterns of data using Python scripts, reporting systems, and data export. This book examines how to go about obtaining, processing, storing, managing and analyzing data using the Python programming language.


You will use Python and other open source tools to wrangle data and tease out interesting and important trends in that data that will allow you to predict future
patterns. Whether you are dealing with sales data, investment data (stocks, bonds, etc.), medical data, web page usage, or any other type of data set, Python can be used to interpret, analyze, and glean information from a pile of numbers and statistics. 

This book is an invaluable reference with its examples of storing and accessing data in a database; it walks you through the process of report generation; it provides three real world case studies or examples that you can take with you for your everyday analysis needs.

## Installation of pandas

The easiest and most general way to install the pandas library is to use a prepackaged solution, i.e., installing it through an Anaconda or Enthought distribution.

### Installation from Anaconda

For those who choose to use the Anaconda distribution, managing the installation is very simple. First you have to see if the pandas module is installed and, if so, which version. To do this, type the following command from the terminal:

```
conda list pandas
```
Since I have the module installed on my PC (Windows), I get the following result:

```
# packages in environment at C:\Users\Fabio\Anaconda:
#
pandas                    0.20.3               py36hce827b7_2
```
If you do not have pandas installed, you will need to install it. Enter the following command:

```
conda install pandas
```

Anaconda will immediately check all dependencies, managing the installation of other modules, without you having to worry too much.

```
Solving environment: done
## Package Plan ##
Environment location: C:\Users\Fabio\Anaconda3
added / updated specs:
   - pandas
```

The following new packages will be installed:

```
    Pandas: 0.22.0-py36h6538335_0
Proceed ([y]/n)?
Press the y key on your keyboard to continue the installation.
Preparing transaction: done
Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: done
```

If you want to upgrade your package to a newer version, the command to do so is very simple and intuitive:

```
conda update pandas
```

The system will check the version of pandas and the version of all the modules on which it depends and then suggest any updates. It will then ask if you want to proceed to the update.

```
Installation from PyPI
```

pandas can also be installed by PyPI using this command :

```
pip install pandas
```

### Installation on Linux

If you’re working on a Linux distribution, and you choose not to use any of these prepackaged distributions, you can install the pandas module like any other package.

On Debian and Ubuntu distributions, use this command:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pandas
```

While on OpenSuse and Fedora, enter the following command:

```
zypper in python-pandas
```

### Installation from Source

If you want to compile your pandas module from the source code, you can find what you need on GitHub at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas :

```
git clone git://github.com/pydata/pandas.git
cd pandas
python setup.py install
```

Make sure you have installed Cython at compile time. For more information, read the documentation available on the Web, including the official page ( http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html ).

### A Module Repository for Windows

If you are working on Windows and prefer to manage your packages in order to always have the most current modules, there is also a resource on the Internet where you can download many third-party modules—Christoph Gohlke’s Python Extension Packages for Windows repository ( www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ ). Each module is supplied with the format archival WHL (wheel) in both 32-bit and 64-bit. To install each module, you have to use the pip application (see PyPI in Chapter  2).

```
pip install SomePackege-1.0.whl
```

For example, for pandas you can find and download the following package:

```
pip install pandas-0.22.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
```

When choosing the module, be careful to choose the correct version for your version of Python and the architecture on which you’re working. Furthermore, while NumPy does not require the installation of other packages, on the contrary, pandas has many dependencies. So make sure you get them all. The installation order is not important.

The disadvantage of this approach is that you need to install the packages individually without a package manager that can help manage versioning and interdependencies between the various packages. The advantage is greater mastery of the modules and their versions, so you have the most current modules possible without depending on the choices of the distributions.
