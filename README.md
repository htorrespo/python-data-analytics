Data Analysis and Science Using Pandas, matplotlib, and the Python Programming Language


Python Data Analytics will help you tackle the world of data acquisition and analysis using the power of the Python language. At the heart of this book lies the coverage of pandas, an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

Author Fabio Nelli expertly shows the strength of the Python programming language when applied to processing, managing and retrieving information. Inside, you will see how intuitive and flexible it is to discover and communicate meaningful patterns of data using Python scripts, reporting systems, and data export. This book examines how to go about obtaining, processing, storing, managing and analyzing data using the Python programming language.


You will use Python and other open source tools to wrangle data and tease out interesting and important trends in that data that will allow you to predict future
patterns. Whether you are dealing with sales data, investment data (stocks, bonds, etc.), medical data, web page usage, or any other type of data set, Python can be used to interpret, analyze, and glean information from a pile of numbers and statistics. 

This book is an invaluable reference with its examples of storing and accessing data in a database; it walks you through the process of report generation; it provides three real world case studies or examples that you can take with you for your everyday analysis needs.

## Installation of pandas

The easiest and most general way to install the pandas library is to use a prepackaged solution, i.e., installing it through an Anaconda or Enthought distribution.

### Installation from Anaconda

For those who choose to use the Anaconda distribution, managing the installation is very simple. First you have to see if the pandas module is installed and, if so, which version. To do this, type the following command from the terminal:

```
conda list pandas
```
Since I have the module installed on my PC (Windows), I get the following result:

```
# packages in environment at C:\Users\Fabio\Anaconda:
#
pandas                    0.20.3               py36hce827b7_2
```
If you do not have pandas installed, you will need to install it. Enter the following command:

```
conda install pandas
```

Anaconda will immediately check all dependencies, managing the installation of other modules, without you having to worry too much.

```
Solving environment: done
## Package Plan ##
Environment location: C:\Users\Fabio\Anaconda3
added / updated specs:
   - pandas
```

The following new packages will be installed:

```
    Pandas: 0.22.0-py36h6538335_0
Proceed ([y]/n)?
Press the y key on your keyboard to continue the installation.
Preparing transaction: done
Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: done
```

If you want to upgrade your package to a newer version, the command to do so is very simple and intuitive:

```
conda update pandas
```

The system will check the version of pandas and the version of all the modules on which it depends and then suggest any updates. It will then ask if you want to proceed to the update.

```
Installation from PyPI
```

pandas can also be installed by PyPI using this command :

```
pip install pandas
```

### Installation on Linux

If you’re working on a Linux distribution, and you choose not to use any of these prepackaged distributions, you can install the pandas module like any other package.

On Debian and Ubuntu distributions, use this command:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pandas
```

While on OpenSuse and Fedora, enter the following command:

```
zypper in python-pandas
```

### Installation from Source

If you want to compile your pandas module from the source code, you can find what you need on GitHub at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas :

```
git clone git://github.com/pydata/pandas.git
cd pandas
python setup.py install
```

Make sure you have installed Cython at compile time. For more information, read the documentation available on the Web, including the official page ( http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html ).

### A Module Repository for Windows

If you are working on Windows and prefer to manage your packages in order to always have the most current modules, there is also a resource on the Internet where you can download many third-party modules—Christoph Gohlke’s Python Extension Packages for Windows repository ( www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ ). Each module is supplied with the format archival WHL (wheel) in both 32-bit and 64-bit. To install each module, you have to use the pip application (see PyPI in Chapter  2).

```
pip install SomePackege-1.0.whl
```

For example, for pandas you can find and download the following package:

```
pip install pandas-0.22.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
```

When choosing the module, be careful to choose the correct version for your version of Python and the architecture on which you’re working. Furthermore, while NumPy does not require the installation of other packages, on the contrary, pandas has many dependencies. So make sure you get them all. The installation order is not important.

The disadvantage of this approach is that you need to install the packages individually without a package manager that can help manage versioning and interdependencies between the various packages. The advantage is greater mastery of the modules and their versions, so you have the most current modules possible without depending on the choices of the distributions.

## Testing Your pandas Installation

The pandas library can run a check after it’s installed to verify the internal controls (the official documentation states that the test provides a 97% coverage of all the code inside).

First, make sure you have installed the nose module in your Python distribution (see the “Nose Module” sidebar). If you did, you can start the test by entering the following command:

```
nosetests pandas
```

The test will take several minutes and in the end it will show a list of any problems encountered.

### Nose Module

This module is designed for testing Python code during the development phases of a project or a Python module in particular. This module extends the capabilities of the unittest module. The Python module involved in testing the code, however, making its coding much simpler and easier.

I suggest you read this article at http://pythontesting.net/framework/nose/nose-introduction/ for more information.


## Getting Started with pandas

The best way to get started with pandas is to open a Python shell and type commands one by one. This way, you have the opportunity to become familiar with the individual functions and data structures that are explained in this chapter.

Furthermore, the data and functions defined in the various examples remain valid throughout the chapter, which means you don’t have to to define them each time. You are invited, at the end of each example, to repeat the various commands, modify them if appropriate, and control how the values in the data structures vary during operation. This approach is great for getting familiar with the different topics covered in this chapter, leaving you the opportunity to interact freely with what you are reading.

Note

This chapter assumes that you have some familiarity with Python and NumPy in general. If you have any difficulty, read Chapters  2 and  3 of this book.

First, open a session on the Python shell and then import the pandas library. The general practice for importing the pandas module is as follows:

```
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
```

Thus, in this chapter and throughout the book, every time you see pd and np, you’ll make reference to an object or method referring to these two libraries, even though you will often be tempted to import the pandas module in this way:

```
>>> from pandas import *
```

Thus, you no longer have to reference a function, object, or method with pd; this approach is not considered good practice by the Python community in general.

## Introduction to pandas Data Structures

The heart of pandas is the two primary data structures on which all transactions, which are generally made during the analysis of data, are centralized:

- Series
- Dataframes

The series, as you will see, constitutes the data structure designed to accommodate a sequence of one-dimensional data, while the dataframe, a more complex data structure, is designed to contain cases with several dimensions.

Although these data structures are not the universal solution to all problems, they do provide a valid and robust tool for most applications. In fact, they remain very simple to understand and use. In addition, many cases of more complex data structures can still be traced to these simple two cases.

However, their peculiarities are based on a particular feature—integration in their structure of index objects and labels. You will see that this feature causes these data structures to be easily manipulated.

### The Series

The series is the object of the pandas library designed to represent one-dimensional data structures, similar to an array but with some additional features. Its internal structure is simple (see Figure 4-1) and is composed of two arrays associated with each other. The main array holds the data (data of any NumPy type) to which each element is associated with a label, contained within the other array, called the index.

### Declaring a Series

To create the series specified in Figure 4-1, you simply call the Series() constructor and pass as an argument an array containing the values to be included in it.

```
>>> s = pd.Series([12,-4,7,9])
>>> s
0    12
1    -4
2     7
3     9
dtype: int64
```

As you can see from the output of the series, on the left there are the values in the index, which is a series of labels, and on the right are the corresponding values.

If you do not specify any index during the definition of the series, by default, pandas will assign numerical values increasing from 0 as labels. In this case, the labels correspond to the indexes (position in the array) of the elements in the series object.

Often, however, it is preferable to create a series using meaningful labels in order to distinguish and identify each item regardless of the order in which they were inserted into the series.

In this case it will be necessary, during the constructor call, to include the index option and assign an array of strings containing the labels.

```
>>> s = pd.Series([12,-4,7,9], index=['a','b','c','d'])
>>> s
a    12
b    -4
c     7
d     9
dtype: int64
```

If you want to individually see the two arrays that make up this data structure, you can call the two attributes of the series as follows: index and values.

```
>>> s.values
array([12, -4,  7,  9], dtype=int64)
>>> s.index
Index([u'a', u'b', u'c', u'd'], dtype="object")
```

### Selecting the Internal Elements


You can select individual elements as ordinary numpy arrays, specifying the key.

```
>>> s[2]
7
```

Or you can specify the label corresponding to the position of the index.

```
>>> s['b']
-4
```

In the same way you select multiple items in a numpy array, you can specify the following:

```
>>> s[0:2]
a    12
b    -4
dtype: int64
```

In this case, you can use the corresponding labels, but specify the list of labels in an array.

```
>>> s[['b','c']]
b   -4
c    7
dtype: int64
```

### Assigning Values to the Elements

Now that you understand how to select individual elements, you also know how to assign new values to them. In fact, you can select the value by index or by label.
```
>>> s[1] = 0
>>> s
a    12
b     0
c     7
d     9
dtype: int64
>>> s['b'] = 1
>>> s
a    12
b     1
c     7
d     9
dtype: int64
```

### Defining a Series from NumPy Arrays and Other Series

You can define a new series starting with NumPy arrays or with an existing series .

```
>>> arr = np.array([1,2,3,4])
>>> s3 = pd.Series(arr)
>>> s3
0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
dtype: int64
>>> s4 = pd.Series(s)
>>> s4
a    12
b     4
c     7
d     9
dtype: int64
```

Always keep in mind that the values contained in the NumPy array or in the original series are not copied, but are passed by reference. That is, the object is inserted dynamically within the new series object. If it changes, for example its internal element varies in value, then those changes will also be present in the new series object.

```
>>> s3
0    1
1    2
2    3
3    4
dtype: int64
>>> arr[2] = -2
>>> s3
0    1
1    2
2   -2
3    4
dtype: int64
```

As you can see in this example, by changing the third element of the arr array, we also modified the corresponding element in the s3 series.

### Filtering Values

Thanks to the choice of the NumPy library as the base of the pandas library and, as a result, for its data structures, many operations that are applicable to NumPy arrays are extended to the series. One of these is filtering values contained in the data structure through conditions.

For example, if you need to know which elements in the series are greater than 8, you write the following:

```
>>> s[s > 8]
a    12
d     9
dtype: int64
```

### Operations and Mathematical Functions

Other operations such as operators (+, -, *, and /) and mathematical functions that are applicable to NumPy array can be extended to series.

You can simply write the arithmetic expression for the operators.

```
>>> s / 2
a    6.0
b   -2.0
c    3.5
d    4.5
dtype: float64
```

However, with the NumPy mathematical functions, you must specify the function referenced with np and the instance of the series passed as an argument.
```
>>> np.log(s)
a    2.484907
b    0.000000
c    1.945910
d    2.197225
dtype: float64
```

### Evaluating Values

There are often duplicate values in a series. Then you may need to have more information about the samples, including existence of any duplicates and whether a certain value is present in the series.

In this regard, you can declare a series in which there are many duplicate values.

```
>>> serd = pd.Series([1,0,2,1,2,3], index=['white','white','blue','green','green','yellow'])
>>> serd
white     1
white     0
blue      2
green     1
green     2
yellow    3
dtype: int64
```

To know all the values contained in the series, excluding duplicates, you can use the unique() function. The return value is an array containing the unique values in the series, although not necessarily in order.

```
>>> serd.unique()
array([1, 0, 2, 3], dtype=int64)
```

A function that’s similar to unique() is value_counts(), which not only returns unique values but also calculates the occurrences within a series.

```
>>> serd.value_counts()
2    2
1    2
3    1
0    1
dtype: int64
```

Finally, isin() evaluates the membership, that is, the given a list of values. This function tells you if the values are contained in the data structure. Boolean values that are returned can be very useful when filtering data in a series or in a column of a dataframe.

```
>>> serd.isin([0,3])
white     False
white      True
blue      False
green     False
green     False
yellow     True
dtype: bool
>>> serd[serd.isin([0,3])]
white     0
yellow    3
dtype: int64
```

### NaN Values

As you can see in the previous case, we tried to run the logarithm of a negative number and received NaN as a result. This specific value NaN (Not a Number) is used in pandas data structures to indicate the presence of an empty field or something that’s not definable numerically.

Generally, these NaN values are a problem and must be managed in some way, especially during data analysis. These data are often generated when extracting data from a questionable source or when the source is missing data. Furthermore, as you have just seen, the NaN values can also be generated in special cases, such as calculations of logarithms of negative values, or exceptions during execution of some calculation or function. In later chapters, you see how to apply different strategies to address the problem of NaN values.

Despite their problematic nature, however, pandas allows you to explicitly define NaNs and add them to a data structure, such as a series. Within the array containing the values, you enter np.NaN wherever you want to define a missing value.

```
>>> s2 = pd.Series([5,-3,np.NaN,14])
>>> s2
0     5.0
1    -3.0
2   NaN
3    14.0
dtype: float64
```

The isnull() and notnull() functions are very useful to identify the indexes without a value.

```
>>> s2.isnull()
0    False
1    False
2     True
3    False
dtype: bool
>>> s2.notnull()
0     True
1     True
2    False
3     True
dtype: bool
```

In fact, these functions return two series with Boolean values that contain the True and False values, depending on whether the item is a NaN value or less. The isnull() function returns True at NaN values in the series; inversely, the notnull() function returns True if they are not NaN. These functions are often placed inside filters to make a condition.

```
>>> s2[s2.notnull()]
0     5.0
1    -3.0
3    14.0
dtype: float64
>>> s2[s2.isnull()]
2   NaN
dtype: float64
```

### Series as Dictionaries

An alternative way to think of a series is to think of it as an object dict (dictionary). This similarity is also exploited during the definition of an object series. In fact, you can create a series from a previously defined dict.

```
>>> mydict = {'red': 2000, 'blue': 1000, 'yellow': 500,
 'orange': 1000}
>>> myseries = pd.Series(mydict)
>>> myseries
red       2000
blue      1000
yellow     500
orange    1000
dtype: int64
```

As you can see from this example, the array of the index is filled with the keys while the data are filled with the corresponding values. You can also define the array indexes separately. In this case, controlling correspondence between the keys of the dict and labels array of indexes will run. If there is a mismatch, pandas will add the NaN value.

```
>>> colors = ['red','yellow','orange','blue','green']
>>> myseries = pd.Series(mydict, index=colors)
>>> myseries
red       2000.0
yellow     500.0
orange    1000.0
blue      1000.0
green      NaN
dtype: float64
```
